# DNN for Breast Cancer Detection
This is a project based on paper ["Deep Neural Networks Improve Radiologistsâ€™ Performance in Breast Cancer Screening"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08297) and the linked github repo https://github.com/nyukat/breast_cancer_classifier. <br/>
Here we reproduced the networks presented in that paper in Tensorflow.Keras. <br/>
The folder breast_cancer_classifier-master contains the code from the github repo mentioned above that we used for our work.
